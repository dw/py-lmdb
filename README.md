# py-lmdb Has a New Maintainer!

Hi.  My name is Nic Watson.   With lots of help from David, I'm taking over maintenance of py-lmdb.  Please be patient
as we work out the details of the handover.

If you care whether the tests are passing, check out the repository and execute
the tests under your desired target Python release, as the Travis CI build has
a bad habit of breaking due to external factors approximately every 3 months.
